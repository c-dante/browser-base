# pug-inc
A subset of [pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug) templates compiling to [incremental-dom](https://github.com/google/incremental-dom) functions


## Why
Ever see a PHP template? Looks miiiiiiighty similar to the stuff people are building with React, doesn't it...

I'm NOT a fan of code and template mingling. I like my templates to just describe value bindings.

Pug is a really nice, succinct langauge to build nested DOM elements.

Mostly a thought project. Maybe it will take shape. Maybe it won't. Who knows?

### Perf
Example is an implementation of an attempt at [react-fractals](https://github.com/Swizec/react-fractals).
